graph
=====

graph is a simple package for generating mathematical graphs using [Go][golang] functions.

Installation
------------

To install, simply type

> go get -u github.com/DeedleFake/graph

Usage
-----

A Graph requires an Output to render to. Currently, no implementations of Output are provided. The ability to render to a [draw.Image](http://www.golang.org/pkg/image/draw#Image) is planned, but not yet implemented.

For more documentation, see [GoDoc][docs]. For a complete working example, see the example subdirectory.
